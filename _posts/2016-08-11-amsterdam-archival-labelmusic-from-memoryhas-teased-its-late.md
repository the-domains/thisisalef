Amsterdam archival label[**Music From Memory**][0]has teased its latest project, a compilation of contemporary and electronic music from Brazil that skirts the country's dominant musical landscape of post-bossa nova pop music (Música popular brasileiraorMPB for short) to shine light on the fringes of its vastly rich musical heritage.

Not due until early 2017,_Outro Tempo: Electronic and Contemporary Music from Brazil, 1978-1992_has been compiled by collector and DJ John Gómez and, according to Music From Memory's announcement, will explore the "outer edges of Brazilian music; where indigenous rhythms mix with synthesizers and where MPB mingles with drum computers."
